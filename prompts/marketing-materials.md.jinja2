For each of the platforms above, do the following:
- Create the content in a style and format that is appropriate for the platform
- Make sure to highlight the key features and benefits of the project
- Include a link to the project
- Keep the content concise and engaging
- Use appropriate hashtags and mentions where necessary
- Make sure the content is tailored to the audience of the platform
- Save the content for each platform as a Markdown file in `marketing/` with the platform name as the filename (e.g., `marketing/reddit.md`)

Only create the Markdown files, do nothing else. Say "Marketing materials created" when you're done.
