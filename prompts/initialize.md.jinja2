Currently, this project is empty boilerplate code. Here are the details of the prototype I'd like to build:

## The problem it solves
{{ env('WHAT_PROBLEM_ARE_YOU_SOLVING') }}

## My solution
{{ env('YOUR_SOLUTION') }}

## Feature Descriptions
{{ env('DESCRIBE_FEATURES') }}

Initialize the project for me by doing the following:
1. Update `app.py` and the index template with an initial implementation
2. Edit the `.pilot-hints.md` file, replacing the "rapid prototyping template" content with the project details
3. Create a comprehensive `README.md` file and save it
4. Remove `prompts/initialize.md.jinja2`
5. Write comprehensive meta tags for popular social media platforms and for SEO into `templates/base.html.jinja2` file
6. Respond with a short and concise description of your initial implementation and suggested next steps
