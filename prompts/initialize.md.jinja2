Currently, this project is empty boilerplate code. I'm going to define the details of
the prototype I'd like to build:

## Idea / Goal of the Prototype
{{ env('SHORT_IDEA_DESCRIPTION') }}

## Problem Statement
{{ env('PROBLEM_STATEMENT') }}

## Scope and Limitations
{{ env('SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS') }}

Initialize the project for me by doing the following:
1. Edit the `.pilot-hints.md` file, replacing the TODO placeholders with the details of the prototype
2. Update the `README.md` file with the project details
3. Remove `prompts/initialize.md.jinja2`
4. Update the index page so that it contains a first, simple implementation as a starting point
5. Apply SEO best practices to the `templates/base.html.jinja2` file
5. Respond with a short and concise description of the initial implementation
