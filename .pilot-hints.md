This project allows developers to explore and iterate on an idea fast 
using PR Pilot in order to get a working prototype quickly.

## Development Target
Some details on the desired state of this prototype:

### User Story
As a programmer, I want to have customizable background noise to help me focus, so that I can work without distractions.

### Problem Statement
As a programmer, I don't want to listen to music because it is too distracting.

### Scope of the prototype
The prototype should generate noise in the browser with adjustable parameters using sliders.

## Project Setup
This is a webapp that uses:
- Python & FastAPI for the backend in `app.py`
- Jinja2 templates stored in `templates/`
- BulmaCSS for styling
- jQuery for JavaScript functionality
- MongoDB for data storage
- docker-compose for running the app and MongoDB

## Structure
There is a `base.html.jinja2` template that is inherited by every page,
with an initial, empty `index.html.jinja2` template being served at the root path (`/`).
