## Project Description

This project template allows developers to explore and iterate on an idea fast 
using PR Pilot in order to get a working prototype quickly.

### Problem it solves
Creating a new project with UI, backend, and database setup can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Instead of innovating, developers spend time setting up the project and manually iterating on it.

### How it solves it
This is a project template with a select set of technologies that lend itself to fast iteration.
Developers can create a new project on Github using this template and get started quickly:
- AI assistance via PR Pilot to iterate on the project using natural language prompts
- Vercel for quick deployment and analytics with almost 0 setup
- Ready-to-use prompts for: 
  - Initializing the project
  - Generating marketing material for social media, blogs, etc

### Who it solves it for
Indie developers who want to quickly evaluate an idea and get feedback.

## Project Setup
This is a webapp that uses:
- Python & FastAPI for the backend
- Jinja2 templates for rendering the frontend
- BulmaCSS for styling
- jQuery for JavaScript functionality
- Postgres for the database
- SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for migrations
- docker-compose for running the app

## Structure
- Jinja templates are stored in `templates/`
- Backend is implemented in `app/main.py`
- DB models are defined in `app/models.py`
- Pydantic models for request/response validation are defined in `app/schemas.py`
- There is a `base.html.jinja2` template that is inherited by every page.
We have the following pages:
- `index.html.jinja2` served at the root path (`/`).

## Coding Instructions
When writing code, you MUST follow these guidelines:
- Any JS code should make use of jQuery
- Any styling should be done using BulmaCSS classes
- The UI should always be spaced and aligned properly, to be visually appealing to the user
