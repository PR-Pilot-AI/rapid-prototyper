## Project Description

This project allows developers to explore and iterate on an idea fast 
using PR Pilot in order to get a working prototype quickly.

## Project Setup
This is a webapp that uses:
- Python & FastAPI for the backend in `app.py`
- Jinja2 templates stored in `templates/`
- BulmaCSS for styling
- jQuery for JavaScript functionality
- docker-compose for running the app

## Structure
There is a `base.html.jinja2` template that is inherited by every page,
with an initial, empty `index.html.jinja2` template being served at the root path (`/`).

## Coding Instructions
When writing code, you MUST follow these guidelines:
- Any JS code should make use of jQuery
- Any styling should be done using BulmaCSS classes
- The UI should always be spaced and aligned properly, to be visually appealing to the user
